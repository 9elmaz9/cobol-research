# COBOL Research 🖥️  

## Project Description  
This repository is created to explore and conduct research on **COBOL** (Common Business Oriented Language).  

COBOL is one of the oldest programming languages, still widely used in financial systems, banking, and enterprise applications. My goal is to understand its syntax, history, and relevance in modern systems.

---

## What I Am Learning 🔍  
- Basics of COBOL (syntax, program structure).  
- Examples of simple COBOL programs.  
- Practical applications of COBOL in business.  
- Historical context and its current relevance.  

---

## Research Plan 📋  
1. Understanding the syntax and basic structure of COBOL programs.  
2. Writing simple programs for demonstration:  
   - Hello World  
   - Reading and writing data  
   - Arithmetic operations  

3. Exploring tools and frameworks for COBOL development.  
4. Analyzing COBOL's role in legacy and modern systems.

## Code Examples 💻  
A basic "Hello, World!" program in COBOL:  

```cobol
IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
PROGRAM-ID. HelloWorld.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.
    DISPLAY "Hello, World!".
    STOP RUN.
```

## Research Outcomes 🚀
Results and findings will be added as I progress through my research.
Stay tuned for updates in this repository.
